# Markdown web apps

`= this.title` is a [no-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-code_development_platform) & plugin centric framework that turns [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) into minimals or fully featured [static web apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) ready for the [edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing).

Project documentations, blogs, wikis, [digital gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), academia, table-top games, even shops... You organise the content the way you want, and simply reference plugins to add context around and across pages, in seconds.

## gist

PublishKit is targeted at markdown users looking to publish any kind of projects. The `kit` power resides in the Ui & Ux features it can bring to the content. 

By simply referencing a plugin in the frontmatter of a markdown file, you control exactly wich features the published content will gain. By combining plugins, you can build very powerful use cases and applications. 

The `kit` converts markdown files into static html files for you to host anywhere you want. We use github pages, but any hosting provider will do.
