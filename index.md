## usecase

PublishKit is ideal for content based websites and is aimed at markdown users looking to publish their blog, wikis, [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) or projects documentation.

PublishKit can be used natively via it's `cli`, or via a plugin in your favorite [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) software.

Because PublisKit renders static html files, it won't be suitable for projects that requires authentification or databases.
