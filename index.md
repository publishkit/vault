## intro


The kit really shines when used via a markdown PKM like Obsidian or Logseq. By using PKM internal features & plugins, like `[[wiki links]]` or `dataview` queries, you give more capabilities to your content. Combined with the kit plugins, you can shape and ship all kinds of web apps from a single tool.

The kit renders your content into static html pages, inside a folder, that can be hosted anywhere.

Project documentations, blogs, wikis, [digital gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), academia, table-top games, shops... The kit just seats on top of your content, and gives you full control over the UI & UX

Welcome to the `kit` ! We hope you'll have as fun publishing your content as we're having crafting this project.
