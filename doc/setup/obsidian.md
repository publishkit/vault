# Obsidian setup

## install

In Obsidian settings, go to community plugins, search & install "**`=this.title`**".

## use

Now, whenever you want to export a file, you can either:
- click the paper-airplane icon <i class='bx bx-paper-plane'></i> in the left bar
- open command palette with <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>⇧</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and run `PublishKit: export file`
- or assign a shortcut to that command in the Obsidian settings

> [!info]
> Each note is exported independently. When you make a modification to a note you have to export the note again.


## configuration

When you export a note for the first time, `= this.title` will ask you to specify the folder where you want your notes to be exported.
